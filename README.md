# iOScodepath

To submit the pre-work, please follow the instructions here:
You need to develop a Tip Calculator application.
Download Xcode 7 from the App Store.
Follow this video walkthrough. Note that there is one thing that changed in the beta release that doesn't work anymore. In the line where I use bridgeToObjectiveC, use the following line:
var billAmount = NSString(string: billField.text!).doubleValue
Consider adding optional features, more details here. The point of the optional features isn't to test what you can figure out on your own. If you have an idea of something you want to try, email tim@codepath.com, and he'll point you in the right direction.
Submit your work on GitHub by copying the README template here. Be sure to include an animated gif, it only takes a moment to create with LICEcap. To finish your submission, create a GitHub issue and include @codepathreview in the issue body (not the title). Email tim@codepath.com if you're having trouble with GitHub.
